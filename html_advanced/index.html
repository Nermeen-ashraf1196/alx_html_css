                    <p>A centaur was a magical creature whose head, torso, and arms appeared to be human <br>
                       and were joined to a horse's lower body.</p>

                    <h3>Fairy</h3>
                    <p>The fairy is a small and decorative beast of little intelligence. Often used or <br>
                      conjured by wizards for decoration, the fairy generally inhabits woodlands or glades. <br>
                      Ranging in height from one to five inches, the fairy has a minute humanoid body, head, <br>
                      and limbs but sports large insect-like wings, which may be transparent or multi-coloured, <br>
                      according to type.</p>

                    <h3>phoenix</h3>
                    <p>The phoenix was a large swan-sized scarlet magical bird with red and gold plumage, <br>
                      along with a golden beak and talons, black eyes, and a tail as long as a peacock's. <br> 
                      Its scarlet feathers glowed faintly in darkness, while its golden tail feathers were hot <br>
                      to the touch. A phoenix was also one of the most independent and detached creatures <br>
                      in the world. Phoenixes would usually nest on mountain peaks and were gentle herbivores, <br>
                      that were not known for fighting. As phoenixes approach their Burning Day they resembled <br>
                      a half-plucked turkey. Their eyes became dull, their feathers started to fall out, and <br>
                      it began to make gagging noises. Then the bird suddenly burst into flames, only to rise <br>
                      from the ashes shortly after. In a number of days, they grew back to full size.<br>
                      Thanks to this ability, phoenixes lived to an immense age, perhaps even forever.</p>

                    <p>The winged horse was a magical species of horse, distinct for possessing wings which<br>
                       enabled them to fly. Winged horses were found worldwide, with many different breeds <br>
                       existing, including the Abraxan, Aethonan, Granian and Thestral. Owners of winged horses<br>
                        were required by law to cast Disillusionment Charms on them regularly. Owners might <br>
                         compete in a winged horse race.</p>

            <h3>Stag</h3>
            <p>Harry’s Patronus, a stag, is certainly the most prominent in the series (and among the best Patronuses <br>
              in the Wizarding World), as well as the strongest Patronus in the films. </p>

            <h3>Phoenix</h3>
            <p>Albus Dumbledore is the only known character in the series to have a magical creature as his Patronus,<br>
               the Phoenix, and he has many ties with the bird. He revealed to Newt Scamander in the Fantastic Beasts <br>
               series that a Phoenix came to his grandfather in an hour of need, and of course has Fawkes as his companion.</p>

            <h3>Doe</h3>
            <p>Although Severus Snape definitely isn’t the most affectionate character in the series, his Patronus is <br>
              also based around love, as it takes the form of a doe - like Lily’s. Snape was in love with Lily and his <br>
              memories with her are most certainly the basis of his Patronus charm, and why it takes the same form as hers.</p>

            <p>The horse is a beautiful and gentle creature, but also incredibly fierce and noble - much like Ginny Weasley<br>
               herself. These qualities are equally important, and Ginny being able to balance both makes her an incredibly<br>
                strong and skilled young witch.</p>
