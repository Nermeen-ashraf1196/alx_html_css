                    <h3>Centaur</h3>
                    <p>A centaur was a magical creature whose head, torso, and arms appeared to be human <br>
                       and were joined to a horse's lower body.</p>

                    <h3>Fairy</h3>
                    <p>The fairy is a small and decorative beast of little intelligence. Often used or <br>
                      conjured by wizards for decoration, the fairy generally inhabits woodlands or glades. <br>
                      Ranging in height from one to five inches, the fairy has a minute humanoid body, head, <br>
                      and limbs but sports large insect-like wings, which may be transparent or multi-coloured, <br>
                      according to type.</p>

                    <h3>phoenix</h3>
                    <p>The phoenix was a large swan-sized scarlet magical bird with red and gold plumage, <br>
                      along with a golden beak and talons, black eyes, and a tail as long as a peacock's. <br> 
                      Its scarlet feathers glowed faintly in darkness, while its golden tail feathers were hot <br>
                      to the touch. A phoenix was also one of the most independent and detached creatures <br>
                      in the world. Phoenixes would usually nest on mountain peaks and were gentle herbivores, <br>
                      that were not known for fighting. As phoenixes approach their Burning Day they resembled <br>
                      a half-plucked turkey. Their eyes became dull, their feathers started to fall out, and <br>
                      it began to make gagging noises. Then the bird suddenly burst into flames, only to rise <br>
                      from the ashes shortly after. In a number of days, they grew back to full size.<br>
                      Thanks to this ability, phoenixes lived to an immense age, perhaps even forever.</p>

                    <p>The winged horse was a magical species of horse, distinct for possessing wings which<br>
                       enabled them to fly. Winged horses were found worldwide, with many different breeds <br>
                       existing, including the Abraxan, Aethonan, Granian and Thestral. Owners of winged horses<br>
                        were required by law to cast Disillusionment Charms on them regularly. Owners might <br>
                         compete in a winged horse race.</p>

            <h3>Stag</h3>
            <p>Harry’s Patronus, a stag, is certainly the most prominent in the series (and among the best Patronuses <br>
              in the Wizarding World), as well as the strongest Patronus in the films. </p>

            <h3>Phoenix</h3>
            <p>Albus Dumbledore is the only known character in the series to have a magical creature as his Patronus,<br>
               the Phoenix, and he has many ties with the bird. He revealed to Newt Scamander in the Fantastic Beasts <br>
               series that a Phoenix came to his grandfather in an hour of need, and of course has Fawkes as his companion.</p>

            <h3>Doe</h3>
            <p>Although Severus Snape definitely isn’t the most affectionate character in the series, his Patronus is <br>
              also based around love, as it takes the form of a doe - like Lily’s. Snape was in love with Lily and his <br>
              memories with her are most certainly the basis of his Patronus charm, and why it takes the same form as hers.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              <h4>Did Harry, Ron and Hermione ever finish their schooling?</h4>
              <p>Rowling has since revealed that Hermione, ever the studious member of the trio, did return to Hogwarts to do her NEWTs, but Ron and Harry didn't.</p>

              <h4>Whose murders did Voldemort use to create the Horcruxes?</h4>
              <ul> 
                <li>The diary was, of course, created after Moaning Myrtle's murder.</li>
                <li>Helga Hufflepuff's cup became one courtesy of previous owner Hepzibah Smith's death.</li>
                <li>the locket was created after he murdered a "Muggle tramp".</li>
                <li>Nagini became a horcrux after Voldermort murdered Bertha Jorkins, the Department of Magical <br>
                  Games and Sports employee who went missing on holiday in Albania just before the Quidditch World <br>
                  Cup."Voldemort could use a wand once he regained a rudimentary body, as long as the victim was subdued", Rowling explained.</li>
                <li>Marvolo Gaunt's ring became a horcrux after Voldemort murdered his father, Tom Riddle Snr.</li>
                <li>he hid another sliver of his soul inside Ravenclaw's diadem with the murder of an Albanian peasant.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Why didn't Harry use a Time Turner to go back in time and stop his parents from dying/kill Voldemort as a baby?</h4>
              <p>Time travel in the Harry Potter books follow the stable time loop theory-- you can't change the past because it has already happened. If Harry were to go back in time and kill Voldemort, there would be no Voldemort in the present day to inspire him to do this because there is only one, unchanging timeline.</p>

              <h4>Why couldn't the Ministry find Sirius with an owl?</h5>
              <p> Just as wizards can make buildings unplottable, they can also make themselves untraceable. <br>
                Voldemort would have been found long ago if it had been as simple as sending him an owl!</p>
