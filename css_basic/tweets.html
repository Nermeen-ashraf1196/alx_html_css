            Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J.K. Rowling, 
            which follows the life of a young orphan boy named Harry Potter who discovers that he is a wizard and 
            attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with his friends Ron Weasley and 
            Hermione Granger, Harry faces many challenges as he learns about the wizarding world and battles 
            against the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents and seeks to take over
